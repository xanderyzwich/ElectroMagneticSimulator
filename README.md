This tool is intended for educational purposes. It is designed to provide a visible representation of electro-magnetic fields.

Images are mapped to Numpy arrays  
[Picutres](https://github.com/xanderyzwich/ElectroMagneticSimulator/tree/master/pictures) are basis of different models  
[output](https://github.com/xanderyzwich/ElectroMagneticSimulator/tree/master/output) demonstrates of the ouput from different cases  
[paper](https://github.com/xanderyzwich/ElectroMagneticSimulator/tree/master/paper) contains data for the writeup and [explanation of the code](https://github.com/xanderyzwich/ElectroMagneticSimulator/blob/master/paper/details%20of%20code.txt)
